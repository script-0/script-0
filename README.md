### Hi ! :smiley: ðŸ‘‹
I'm **Isaac NDEMA**. Interested in teaching a machine to do things it was not programmed to do; a little bit of cybersecurity and everything that is challenging : keep things simple. Also, I'm a :mortar_board: Master student in Computer Engineering at [Polytech Yaounde](https://polytechnique.cm)

 - I am looking for my way in this vast world of computer science: :thought_balloon: *What if we were interested in quantum cryptography :grey_question:*
 - :notes: In my ears, a bit of Drill Instrumental. Cameroonian web series embellish some days darkened by bugs.
 - :speech_balloon: Reachable via [ Telegram ](https://t.me/IsaacNdema)
